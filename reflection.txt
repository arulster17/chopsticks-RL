I contributed to the project by helping to formalize the problem mathematically, writing milestone 1 & 2, and collecting graphs and metrics for the discussion section for milestone 3. This project taught me a lot about Q-Learning and the process of applying a learning algorithm to a problem. One thing I’ve learned from this project is how important it is to write everything out mathematically. Even though the problem may seem simple, by cleanly writing out things like states, actions, and rewards, the implementation of the code becomes much easier. Lastly, the project also helped me understand the difficulties in adding complexity to an existing problem. Adding 3 players to the chopstick game would make some of the optimizations we did invalid, and would require a completely different approach (multiple Q-Tables).
